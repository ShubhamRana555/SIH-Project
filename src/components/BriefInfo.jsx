            Mental illness, also called mental health disorders, refers to a
            wide range of mental health conditions â€” disorders that affect your
            mood, thinking and behavior. Examples of mental illness include
            depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, eating disorders and
            addictive behaviors. Many people have mental health concerns from
            time to time. But a mental health concern becomes a mental illness
            when ongoing signs and symptoms cause frequent stress and affect
            your ability to function. A mental illness can make you miserable
            and can cause problems in your daily life, such as at school or work
            or in relationships. In most cases, symptoms can be managed with a
            combination of medications and talk therapy (psychotherapy).
